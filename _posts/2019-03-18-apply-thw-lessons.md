## <+ Applying The Hacker Within lessons to a research project +>

<+ In the scientific community, problems may arise when different labs cannot reproduce the work of each other.  As research nowadays involves more and more computation, it is essential to create data analysis workflows that can be reproduced by others, i.e. computational reproducibility.  Previous THW talks introduced a range of tools from the software development world, which can be used to create reproducible workflows to analyse research data.  +>

## <+ Before coming to the talk +>

<+ For this talk the presenter prepared a repository on GitHub containing a workflow to analyse some example data presented in his recent paper.  One of the most important test of reproducibility is to have your workflow being reproduced by another person on a different machine. Before this talk, please try to reproduce the presenter's workflow on your machine: just follow the instructions in his GitHub repo [here][code].
